# X Machina

This idea was concieved in 2023, when a couple of friends and I decided to begin the contruction of a PenSec tool, similar to Rapid7's Metasploit Framework. I wanted it to be integrated into Linux, and I wanted it to be like the NSA's TAO tool Fuzzbunch. It started out as little more than a dump for rough code, but through continuous development, it has reached a point where testing can begin.

Any and all code in here is for educational purposes only. I do not condone the illegal usage of any tools in here, nor do I hold any responsibility for any actions that do so.
